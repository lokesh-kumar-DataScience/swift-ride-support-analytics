# SwiftRide Support Excellence – Business Intelligence Case Study

## Overview
This project is a business intelligence case study focused on analyzing customer support operations for a large-scale ride-hailing platform (anonymized as SwiftRide). The analysis was created as part of an interview case study and demonstrates how data-driven insights can be used to improve service quality, reduce operational costs, and mitigate safety risks.

---

## Business Problem
SwiftRide’s India support operations were experiencing a high ticket reopen rate (26.66%), indicating poor first-contact resolution and inconsistent handling of critical issues. Leadership needed to understand:
- Why customers were recontacting support
- Which concern types posed the highest operational and safety risk
- The financial impact of reopens
- What interventions would deliver the highest ROI

---

## Stakeholders
- India Operations Leadership  
- Customer Support & Quality Teams  
- Safety & Risk Management  
- Finance & Strategy  

---

## Data & Constraints
- Support ticket data covering a 6-week period
- Metrics available: ticket volume, reopen rate, CSAT, AHT, concern type
- Key revenue metric (Gross Bookings) was not available

### Handling Missing Data
Since Gross Bookings were unavailable, **Contact Rate per Trip** was used as an operational proxy, based on the business relationship:  
Higher contact rate → more unresolved issues → lower satisfaction → reduced repeat usage → lower bookings.

---

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Ticket volume by concern type  
- Reopen rate  
- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)  
- Average Handling Time (AHT)  
- Cost per ticket and cost of reopens  
- Contact rate per trip (proxy metric)  

---

## Key Insights
- Overall reopen rate of **26.66%** indicates systemic quality gaps.
- Safety-related concerns (Rash Driving, Accidents) showed the highest risk:
  - Rash Driving: **40.2% reopen rate**, **72.5 CSAT**
  - Accident tickets showed extreme AHT variability, indicating inconsistent handling.
- Reopened tickets doubled handling effort, resulting in **₹35.5 Cr operational cost leakage over 6 weeks**.
- Poor first-contact resolution was the primary driver of inefficiency and customer dissatisfaction.

---

## Business Impact Quantification
- Cost per initial ticket: ₹486.77  
- Cost per reopened ticket: ₹973.53  
- Total reopen cost (6 weeks): ₹35.5 Cr  
- Opportunity with 20% reopen reduction:
  - ₹7.1 Cr savings in 6 weeks
  - ₹61.6 Cr annualized savings potential

---

## Recommendations
1. **Safety Concern Resolution Framework**  
   Standardize handling for Rash Driving & Accident cases to improve CSAT and reduce reopens.
2. **First-Contact Resolution (FCR) Program**  
   Introduce quality checklists before ticket closure to reduce reopen rate from 26.7% → 12%.
3. **Invoice Automation & Self-Service**  
   Eliminate high-volume, low-complexity tickets.
4. **Real-Time Quality Dashboards**  
   Monitor CSAT, AHT, and reopen rates by concern type.
5. **Structured Escalation for Lost Items**  
   Reduce unnecessary follow-ups and repeated contacts.

---

## Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):** Quick wins, dashboards, safety protocol draft  
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–10):** FCR rollout, agent training, AHT optimization  
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 11+):** Predictive escalation and advanced analytics  

---

## Future Dashboard Design
This analysis can be extended into interactive dashboards tracking:
- Reopen rate trends by concern type  
- CSAT vs AHT correlation  
- Cost leakage from reopens  
- Contact rate per trip over time
